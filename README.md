Cleaning invalid mails and phone numbers from a database in the Laravel framework



The Python code first imports the pymysql and PyEmailValidator modules. Then, it connects to the database and reads the data from the table_name table. Next, it uses the PyEmailValidator module to clean the email addresses in the Email 1, Email 2, and Email 3 columns. Finally, it cleans the phone numbers in the Main Phone column and saves the cleaned data to the database.

The code has the following merits:

It is a simple and easy-to-understand code.
It uses a reliable and functional email validator module.
It can be used to clean both email addresses and phone numbers


To integrate the code in a Laravel framework:

Install the pymysql and PyEmailValidator modules in your Laravel project.
Create a new controller class that will handle the cleaning of the email addresses and phone numbers.
In the controller class, create a new method that will connect to the database and read the data from the table_name table.
In the same method, use the PyEmailValidator module to clean the email addresses and phone numbers in the Email 1, Email 2, and Email 3 columns.
Save the cleaned data to the database.
Create a new route in your Laravel project that will point to the controller class.
In the view file, call the controller method to clean the email addresses and phone numbers.
Render the view file.
